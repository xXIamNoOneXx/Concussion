Here's how you can assemble and link the assembly files:

    Save the Assembly Code:

    Save your dropper.asm and shellcode.asm files with the code you want to use.

    Assemble the Code:

    Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your assembly files are located.

    To assemble each assembly file, use the as (GNU Assembler) command:

    bash

as -o dropper.o dropper.asm
as -o shellcode.o shellcode.asm

This command assembles the code in dropper.asm and shellcode.asm and generates object files (dropper.o and shellcode.o).

Link the Code:

Once you have the object files, you can link them into an executable. Create a linker script (e.g., linker.ld) to specify the entry point:

ld

ENTRY(_start)

SECTIONS {
    . = 0x08048000;  /* This is the default ELF load address for executables */

    .text : {
        *(.text)
    }

    .data : {
        *(.data)
    }

    .bss : {
        *(.bss)
    }
}

Now, link the object files using the linker:

bash

ld -T linker.ld -o dropper dropper.o shellcode.o

This command links the object files into an executable named dropper.

Run the Executable:

You can now run the dropper executable:

bash

    ./dropper

    This will execute your custom shellcode.

Please adapt the above steps as needed for your specific environment and requirements. Note that the above commands are for a Linux environment, and the process may differ if you are working on Windows or another platformHere's how you can assemble and link the assembly files:
